Today, I experimented with the time module, recording the cumulative seconds it took for the user to answer each word correctly. I chose to include this as a choice in later graphic visualizations because it allows the user to visualize easily which words they spent longer trying to remember and which words came to their mind immediately. I think time tracking makes my program more useful by offering users another perspective on understanding their progress and identifying areas of further improvement. In addition, I also worked with JSON files to store progress. This allowed my program to save user data, allowing them to decide whether they want to build off of old work or start fresh from scratch. It also gave me a starting point, as my program will check if a flashcard-storing file exists, and if not, it will create one, and if so, it will add to it or empty it first and then add to it depending on the user's desire. I really like this feature because it brings my code closer to the real-world apps out in the market, as most of them allow users to review old vocab and learn new vocab at a customized pace. My next steps are to make my code neater and to start my presentation. If there are other times available after that, I will come back to working on a GUI for my applications.
