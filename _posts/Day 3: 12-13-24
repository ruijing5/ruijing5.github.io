Both yesterday and today, I explored different ways to create a GUI for the flashcard program. I looked into several Python libraries, such as Tkinter, Gradio, Streamlit and ipywidgets. Since I didn’t have too many experiences with coding GUIs beforehand, the process was quite challenging. The first library I experimented with is Tkinter because I thought you recommended it to my friend who is also trying to create a GUI. To familiarize myself, I explored its documentation and found simple snippets of code from online websites to see the basics. However, when I tried running that in my colab notebook, I encountered the same issue repeatedly. After some google searching, I found out that Tkinter doesn't cooperate with the colab environment. This experiment taught me to stay calm under frustrating situations and the importance of fact-checking myself before proceeding because even if I thought I heard something, there is always a good chance that I have misheard. I repeated the same things for all other libraries. Out of everything I’ve tried, I’ve decided to settle on Gradio. However, I was running into issues within that too. Since displaying is one of my reach goals anyway, for now, I’ve decided to focus on other important aspects of my program, such as printing in color visuals and incorporating time. Despite all the challenges, the process is still very eye opening.
