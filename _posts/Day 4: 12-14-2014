title: Day 4: 12/14/2024

Today, I worked on visualizations for my program. I gained a deeper understanding of how limited Colab is compared to other local applications. The library I found previously for adding color, Colorama, also doesn't work directly in Colab because it was designed to work in local terminals. However, luckily, I remembered from our very first training that Colab can work with HTML to produce colored outputs. Although I'm aware that there are other alternatives, I chose HTML because it offered me a great opportunity to review the language and gave me a sense of nostalgia for my subbie year. I did end up including color and different size fonts. In addition, since I was struggling with GUIs trying to create flashcards on an external website, I realized that I could achieve something similar in Colab by directly printing actual flashcards. I'm very happy about all the progress, as the program now looks much more interesting and fun compared to the previous version with only plain black text. I think these changes will greatly encourage user interaction and improve the program's readability. Next time, I'm going to work on JSON files to store my progress so my program can allow users to both review and create flashcards.
