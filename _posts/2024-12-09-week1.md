Today I submitted the proposal and did some research on the libraries I could utilize in my project of creating flashcards. After some searching on official Python documentations and YouTube, I figured that it would be a bit too complicated for me to try creating files and storing all my vocab in some place and rewriting these files as users add new words into them. I would need to learn too much new information for the two-week span of time. One thing I learned in this process is that YouTube comes in as a very handy source for ground research, where dense documentations sometimes may suit better for deep dives. Another thing I liked about YouTube is that it has more visualizations, which helped me process the code better. Earlier tonight I was looking at the rule manual for the JSON library, and my understanding didn't really develop until I watched introduction videos on what the library actually is. In general, compared to other nights, I did today's research more frantically because I was trying to juggle all my other final projects in other classes. However, I'm very happy that I eventually settled on one specific project.Â
