Today I submitted the proposal and did some research on the libraries I could utilize in my project of creating flashcards. After some searching on official Python documentations and YouTube, I figured that it would be a bit too complicated for me to try creating files and storing all my vocab in some place and rewriting these files as users add new words into them. I would need to learn too much new information for the two-week span of time. One thing I learned in this process is that YouTube comes in as a very handy source for ground research, where dense documentations sometimes may suit better for deep dives. Another thing I liked about YouTube is that it has more visualizations, which helped me process the code better. Earlier tonight I was looking at the rule manual for the JSON library, and my understanding didn't really develop until I watched introduction videos on what the library actually is. In general, compared to other nights, I did today's research more frantically because I was trying to juggle all my other final projects in other classes. However, I'm very happy that I eventually settled on one specific project.Â

As my original plan was to only code the flashcard-creating section, I actually ended up coding that along with the practice and 1/3 of the data visualization section (I finished the bar graph that shows the vocab involved and attempts used). There are still some bugs existing in my code, such as when I call everything in my main function, the previous definition still shows up in the same terminal, which should've been erased because the user shouldn't be seeing the answers when practicing. However, I'm very happy with the amount of progress I've made on this project today. I think in the following days, I can definitely finish plotting and attempt JSON to store files or attempt GUI to create a user platform instead of performing everything directly on the Colab page. Lastly, instead of using Plotly, I decided to explore more possibilities, so I introduced myself to the matplotlib library and the numpy library, which both helped me generate my bar graph.
