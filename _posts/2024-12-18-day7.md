Today, I finished off my test cases and did a last review of my code, checking all the docstrings to ensure they are at their newest version. I also revisited and polished all my previous posts, making sure they all have appropriate formatting and clear writing. In addition, I finalized my presentation slides and thought through the examples I will include when I demonstrate my code. I decided to use vocabulary words from the pre-med class I've been auditing over the past two weeks: "osteoprogenitor," "osteoblast," and "osteoclast." I chose these words in hopes that most of the class will be unfamiliar with them, so students could actually have a more immersive experience throughout this flashcard demo because they are actually trying to memorize these new words. 

This will be my last post for this assignment :D

Thank you very much for reading!
