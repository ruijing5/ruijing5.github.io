title: Day 2

As my original plan was to only code the flashcard-creating section, I actually ended up coding that along with the practice and 1/3 of the data visualization section (I finished the bar graph that shows the vocab involved and attempts used). There are still some bugs existing in my code, such as when I call everything in my main function, the previous definition still shows up in the same terminal, which should've been erased because the user shouldn't be seeing the answers when practicing. However, I'm very happy with the amount of progress I've made on this project today. I think in the following days, I can definitely finish plotting and attempt JSON to store files or attempt GUI to create a user platform instead of performing everything directly on the Colab page. Lastly, instead of using Plotly, I decided to explore more possibilities, so I introduced myself to the matplotlib library, which helped me generate my bar graph.Â I really enojoyed playing with matplotlib as it allowed me to play with lots of different colors and fonts. My next steps will include finishing up plotting the data and working on the GUI user interface.
