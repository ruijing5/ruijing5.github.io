Programming in Python is hard and requires a lot of effort, but it is also definitely doable. For this class, while no prior knowledge of Python is necessary, this class does require students to pay well attention to succeed. In addition, I think practice of problem-solving skills is also another determining part for this class. Missions and level-ups assigned are definitely challenging but also manageable with enough understanding of trainings. I came to this class thinking that learning Python would be the biggest goal. However, throughout the semester, I began to notice that the logic—the critical thinking steps taken behind the implementation—could be more important. How one approaches a problem could greatly impact the complexity of code one will need to write or for the computer to process. Lastly, I found it very useful to utilize all the resources given. I found all of them perfectly sufficient for all the issues that arose for me. Although this class discourages students from relying on random sources from the wild web, students can still seek help from office hours, trainings, and official documentations. Therefore, students should never panic when challenges or errors arise. Because if so, there is a good chance that they'll be having panic attacks every 5 minutes. They should remember to take breaks, give persistent effort, and have faith that everything will work out just fine.
